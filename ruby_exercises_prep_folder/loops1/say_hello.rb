LS Answer:
Loops are used regularly in Ruby,
therefore, it's important to understand how to control them based on the program's conditions.
In this exercise, the while loop is set to run based on the condition of say_hello.
Since say_hello was initialized as true, the loop will execute at least once.
Upon the first iteration, however, say_hello is set to false.
Therefore, when while evaluates the condition of say_hello on the second iteration,
it won't execute the block because say_hello equals false.

Now that we understand how this while loop works, we need to modify it to fit the requirements.
In this case, we need to only change say_hello to false if we've said "Hello!" 5 times.
We can accomplish this by adding a counter variable and if condition.
We need count to track the number of times the loop has executed.
Once count reaches 5, our if condition will evaluate to true.

We use Ruby's shorthand way of writing the if condition but it could also be written like this:

if count == 5
  say_hello = false
end

Our solution works well, but there are simpler ways of accomplishing the same thing.

5.times do
  puts 'Hello!'
end

Although using #times may be simpler and lets you write less code,
it's still important to understand the fundamentals of how a method like #times actually works.
Just keep in mind that there's usually more than one way to accomplish a given task.
=end
say_hello = true

while say_hello
  5.times {puts 'Hello!'}
  break
end

#or
puts "______________"

say_hello = true
counter =0

while say_hello
  puts "Hello!"
  counter += 1
  say_hello = false if counter == 5
end
