My Answer:

LS Answer:
The for loop is useful for looping over a set number of elements.
Using for allows us to easily do something with each element in the given array.
In this case, we want to output each name along with a greeting.
We can do this by using the friend variable which represents the current element.
We simply need to output our greeting and friend.

When naming variables in a for loop it's typical to use the standard format:
for friend in friends, for cat in cats, etc.
This makes it clear that we're iterating over friends and doing something with each friend.
=end
friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']
for i in 0..3
  puts "Hello, #{friends[i]}!"
end

puts "______________"
for friend in friends
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end
