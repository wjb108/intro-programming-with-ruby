=begin
The code below shows an example of a for loop. Modify the code so that it only outputs i if i is an odd number.
for i in 1..100
  puts i
end
for loops aren't used very often in Ruby, but it's still important to know how they work.
It's typically used to iterate over a collection. In this case, we use it to iterate over the range 1..100,
therefore, the i variable represents the current iteration number.
This makes it easy to count from 1 to 100 by outputting the value of i.

For this exercise, we'd like to only output the odd numbers.
We can do this by adding an if statement to #puts.
We can tell #puts to only output i if i is an odd number by using the #odd? method on i.

My Answer:

LS Answer:

=end
for i in 1..100
  puts i if i % 2 != 0
end

# or

for i in 1..100
  puts i if i.odd?
end
