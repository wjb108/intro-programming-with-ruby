Use Hash#select to iterate over numbers and return a hash containing only key-value pairs
where the value is less than 25. Assign the returned hash to a variable named low_numbers and
print its value using #p.

numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}

Expected output:

{:low=>10}

  low:    10
}

low_numbers = numbers.select {|k, v| v < 25}
