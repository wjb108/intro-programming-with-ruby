This problem looks remarkably similar to the first problem in this set.
However, this time we are working with a string, and we are assigning to b[2] instead of b.

The result is quite different.
When we were working with a numeric variable, no changes were made to a.
This was due to the fact that numbers are immutable, and assignment merely changes the object that a variable references.
Now, though, Strings are mutable - they can be modified - and,
in particular, the method String#[]= is a mutating method; it actually modifies the string.
Since we are actually modifying the string referenced by b, and b references the same string as a,
the result from printing a shows an update to the value of the string.

# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
