#my answer:
#prints 7
# LS answer:
#7
#This problem is identical to the previous problem.
#The only thing we did is change the name b to a.
#Note that we can do this because method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables.
#Local variables outside the method definition are not visible inside the method definition;
#so the top level a is not available inside my_value.
#Furthermore, local variables inside the method definition are not visible outside the method definition;
#so the a inside my_value is a local variable with no top-level visibility.

#What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
