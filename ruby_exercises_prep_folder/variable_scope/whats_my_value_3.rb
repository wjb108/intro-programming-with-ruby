#my answer:
#7
# LS answer:
#Once again, the result is 7.
#Once again, the local variable a inside the my_value method definition is not visible outside the my_value method definition.
#Furthermore, the local variable a at the top level is not visible inside my_value because method definitions are self-contained with respect to local variables.


# What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a
