#my answer:
#print 7
# LS answer:
# Reassignment, including assignment operators like +=, does not mutate a variable;
#instead, it binds the variable to a new object. That is, += sets the variable to point to a different object.
#Since line 4 binds b to a new object, the object pointed to by a remains unchanged.
#Thus, a is still equal to 7 at the time of the puts.

Another way to look at this is that numbers in Ruby are immutable. Thus, there is no way for my_value to mutate the value referenced by b, which means that my_value does not (and can not) change the object referenced by a (7).
#What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.
a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
