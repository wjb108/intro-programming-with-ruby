=begin
In the code below, an array containing the numbers 1 through 5 is assigned to numbers.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Use Array#map to iterate over numbers and return a new array with each number doubled. Assign the returned array to a variable named doubled_numbers and print its value using #p.

Expected output:

[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
=end

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
p numbers.map {|num| num * 2}
